# COVID-19_PREDICTION
Predicting various factors of COVID-19 in India using Holt-Winter's Model of Machine Learning .

# COVID-19 
This has taken the world by storm after first being reported in Wuhan, China in December-2019. Since then, there has been an exponential growth in the number of such cases around the globe. As of 29th April 2020, the total reported cases reached 3,218,183 out of which 228,029 have died. India has been able to contain the spread of the virus due to strict lockdowns in place nationwide. With a lot of researchers working on mitigating this pandemic, there are a lot of datasets available to work on. 

# Using the COVID19 India dataset
I used the daily update of the COVID-19 cases dataset in India and perform Time Series Forecasting on the dataset using the Holt-Winters Methods. At present, the model is predicting various factors caused due to COVID-19 cases up till 31st JULY 2021 whereas data on which model is predicting is based till 6th June 2021. Forecasting is invaluable in allowing us to better understand the current situation and plan for the future. In this project, I provide statistical forecasts for the following features cased due to COVID-19 using robust time series models Holt-Winters.
